# Jang Seeder Wheel

This is a parametric seeder wheel, with default parameters for a Jang seeder. You can adjust things like the diameter and borehole to adjust for your printer's tolerances. You can also adjust the number of seed cells and their size.

I started from an existing Jang wheel, took measurements, and implemented a fully parameterized version out of shape primitives.

The transcluded version (`seed_wheel.scad`) is available [on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4462838).  It was built using:

```bash
./build.sh
```
